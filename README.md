just starting out as a full stack dev — learning everything bit by bit, from frontend to backend and whatever comes in between.

## I'm currently Learning 📖
### frontend: html, css, js (slowly getting into react)

### backend: node.js, express (still figuring things out)

### databases: mysql, mongodb (basics for now)

tools: git, vs code etc.

## And what i am doing now? 🙂

building small projects to understand how things connect  🌱
trying not to copy-paste without understanding.
breaking things on purpose, then fixing hem. (mostly 😂)

## You can find me:
coding at weird hours 🦉🌃


 (not like that im not going to change this every time i will get better 👍)
