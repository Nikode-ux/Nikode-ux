just starting out as a full stack dev — learning everything bit by bit, from frontend to backend and whatever comes in between.

## I'm currently Learning 📖
### frontend: html, css, js

### backend: node.js (still figuring things out) and python

### databases: for now i'm leaving this alone as my goal is NOT learning everything at once.

tools: git, vs code etc.

## And what i am doing now? 🙂

building small projects to understand how things connect  🌱
trying not to copy-paste without understanding.
breaking things on purpose, then fixing hem. (mostly 😂)

## You can find me:
coding at weird hours 🦉🌃


 (not like that im not going to change this every time i will get better 👍)
