Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm a beginner **full-stack developer**, and I'm on an exciting journey to sharpen my skills and grow every day. I believe that with curiosity and consistent effort, there's nothing you can't learn! 

## About Me
I'm passionate about building real-world projects and finding creative ways to solve problems through code. As someone who's still learning, I enjoy experimenting with new tools and technologies while figuring out what inspires me the most in this field. 

### Technologies & Skills
Here are a few technologies and tools I've been working with as I learn more about full-stack development:
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Databases:** SQL, NoSQL
- And I'm constantly adding to the list!

### What I’m Working On
Right now, I’m diving into the world of **AI** and developing a project that I’m really excited about. It’s challenging, but it’s fueling my curiosity and pushing me to grow.
