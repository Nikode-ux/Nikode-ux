just starting out as a full stack dev — learning everything bit by bit, from frontend to backend and whatever comes in between.

## I'm currently Learning:
frontend: html, css, js (slowly getting into react)

backend: node.js, express (still figuring things out)

databases: mysql, mongodb (basics for now)

tools: git, vs code, postman

## And what i am doing now? 

building small projects to understand how things connect
trying not to copy-paste without understanding.
breaking things on purpose, then fixing hem. (mostly 😂)

## You can find me:
coding at weird hours


 (not like that im not going to change this every time i will get better 👍)
